# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation
change.

## Current Phase

Complete — The Algorithm Chooses the Day Pattern (MW / TTh)
(the Dean no longer picks a subject's MW-vs-TTh pattern; `generate` tries
both day patterns per subject, prefers MW, and records the chosen pattern on
the resulting schedule rows — subjects no longer store `dayPattern`)

## Current Goal

Remove `dayPattern` from the Subject as a Dean input. The CSP now builds a
per-subject **domain** with one session-pair option per pattern (MW first,
then TTh) and backtracks over the combined candidates (most-constrained
subject first by total candidate count), so a subject is infeasible only when
BOTH patterns fail. `PlacedSession`/`schedules` rows carry the chosen
`dayPattern` as an output; `validate` and the GA read it from placed
sessions; diagnostics explain each failed pattern separately (cause + free
windows + message per pattern). UI: no "Schedule Pattern" field/column on
subjects; the schedule table and per-pattern error accordion read the pattern
from schedule records. Dev was migrated (3 subjects stripped, 6 backfilled
schedule rows) via an optional→required schema window
(`migrations:backfillSubjectRemoveDayPattern` +
`migrations:backfillScheduleDayPatterns`). Lint + build perfectly clean and
39/39 smoke assertions pass.

## Completed

- **Algorithm Chooses the Day Pattern (MW / TTh), not the Dean** — full unit:
  - `convex/scheduling/types.ts`: `SchedulingSubject` no longer carries
    `dayPattern`; `PlacedSession` gains `dayPattern`;
    `InfeasibilityReason` is now `{ subjectName, durationMinutes, patterns }`
    where `patterns: readonly PatternInfeasibility[]`
    (`{ dayPattern, day1FreeWindows, day2FreeWindows, cause, message }`);
    `CspInfeasibleReason` drops `invalid-pattern` (no pattern to validate).
  - `convex/scheduling/csp.ts` rewritten: new `SubjectDomain
    { subject, options }` — one `SubjectUnit` per pattern (MW first, then
    TTh), each with its own candidates; `expandSubjectsIntoSessions` returns
    `{ domains, reasons, reason }`, generating an infeasibility reason only
    when BOTH patterns have zero candidates. Search sorts domains by **total
    candidate count across both options** (MRV) then plans each subject by
    trying MW candidates then TTh candidates — a subject is infeasible only
    if neither pattern fits. `diagnoseFailedPlacement` greedily places
    domains the same way; `toPlacedSessions` tags each session's pattern;
    `invalid-pattern` validation removed.
  - `convex/scheduling/cspDiagnostics.ts`: new `explainPatternFailure`
    (per pattern: cause + windows + message); `explainInfeasibility` returns
    one entry per pattern (MW then TTh) so the UI can show exactly what
    blocks each. `freeWindowsForDay`/`sharedStartTimes` unchanged.
  - `convex/scheduling/validate.ts`: pattern days now come from the placed
    session's `dayPattern` (not the subject); pair/time/room/block checks
    unchanged.
  - `convex/scheduling/ga.ts`: after `expandSubjectsIntoSessions`, builds one
    unit per subject by matching each domain's option to the seed solution's
    chosen pattern (fallback: first option), locking the CSP's pattern choice
    into the GA's chromosome; decode/validate unchanged.
  - `convex/schedule.ts`: `sessionValidator` + written sessions carry
    `dayPattern`; `SubjectRow`/`buildSchedulingInput` drop it; single-subject
    infeasibility summary now references "can't place on either MW or TTh".
  - `convex/schema.ts`: `subjects` drops `dayPattern`;
    `schedules` adds required `dayPattern`.
  - `convex/subjects.ts`: `subjectFields`/create/update drop `dayPattern`.
  - `convex/migrations.ts`: added idempotent `backfillSubjectRemoveDayPattern`
    (rewrites subject docs without the field) and
    `backfillScheduleDayPatterns` (derives each old row's pattern from its
    actual days: {0,2}→MW, {1,3}→TTh); `backfillSubjectRoomIds` replace no
    longer writes `dayPattern`; obsolete `backfillSubjectDayPatterns` removed.
  - Frontend: `types/subjects.ts`, `lib/validation/subject.ts`,
    `components/subjects/SubjectFormDialog.tsx` (pattern select removed),
    `components/subjects/SubjectManagement.tsx` (pattern column + search
    terms removed); `types/schedule.ts` (`ScheduleSession.dayPattern`;
    `InfeasibleSubject.patterns: InfeasiblePattern[]`);
    `components/schedule/ScheduleTable.tsx` (pattern badge reads
    `sessions[0].dayPattern`); `components/schedule/ScheduleGenerationError.tsx`
    (per-pattern accordion entries: pattern badge + cause label + message +
    both days' free-window blocks).
  - Migration (dev): raw data had 3 subjects WITH `dayPattern` and 6 schedule
    rows WITHOUT it. Since this CLI (Convex 1.46) exposes no
    `schema:push --relax`, the window was expressed in the schema itself:
    (1) `subjects.dayPattern` / `schedules.dayPattern` made optional, push;
    (2) ran `migrations:backfillSubjectRemoveDayPattern` (cleaned 3) and
    `migrations:backfillScheduleDayPatterns` (backfilled 6 — all MW, matching
    their day indexes); (3) final schema (subject field removed, schedule
    field required), re-push. Verified via `convex data` that subjects have
    no `dayPattern` and every schedule row does.
  - Verification: `scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` rewritten —
    **39/39 assertions**: feasible case with MW-default (every subject lands
    Mon+Wed), Math still pinned to slot 9, GA stays valid while keeping the
    seed-chosen pattern, **TTh fallback when MW is fully blocked**,
    25-subject one-room overflow → `no-room-available`, duration validation,
    SE 101 dev mirror, 3-subject dev seed, fully-blocked teachers → one
    reason per subject with **both** patterns explained (empty windows + "No
    matching start time"), pattern-availability mirroring, and a reworked
    room-vs-teacher distinction (TTh fully blocked so the pair can't split —
    MW reports `no-room-available`, TTh reports `no-shared-teacher-window`).
    Root `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` (0 errors — same
    5 pre-existing warnings), `npm run build` passes, functions + schema
    pushed to dev.

- Initial project scaffold (Next.js 16 + Convex + Clerk)
- Convex user synchronization and user schema (upsert by Clerk user id)
- Role-based routing and dashboards for Dean and Teacher roles
- Installed shadcn (`init --defaults`, style `base-nova`, base: Base UI)
  — generated `components.json`, `lib/utils.ts`, `components/ui/*`
- Installed `lucide-react` (done by shadcn init; iconLibrary = lucide)
- Added shadcn sidebar + deps (button, input, separator, skeleton,
  tooltip, sheet, `hooks/use-mobile.ts`)
- Added dean nav routes to `constants/routes.ts`:
  `APP_ROUTES.deanRooms` ("/dean/rooms"), `APP_ROUTES.deanSubjects`
  ("/dean/subjects")
- Built `components/DeanSidebar.tsx` — shadcn Sidebar (`collapsible="icon"`)
  with lucide icons: Dashboard, Manage Rooms, Manage Subjects; uses
  `usePathname` for active state; links via `next/link`
- Built `app/dean/layout.tsx` — `SidebarProvider` + `DeanSidebar` +
  content column with `SidebarTrigger`; gateway `requireRole(ROLES.dean)`
  for every dean route
- Root layout now defines `--app-header-height` (3.5rem) on `<body>`;
  `AppHeader` uses it, and the Dean sidebar offsets below the white header
  so it never overlaps top chrome
- **Dean Subject CRUD (spec 02)** — full unit:
  - Installed shadcn `table`, `badge`, `dialog`, `select`, `label`,
    `alert-dialog` primitives; added `zod` dependency
  - Added `subjects` table to `convex/schema.ts` (name, durationMinutes,
    meetingsPerWeek, roomType `lecture|lab`, teacherId = Clerk user id,
    createdAt/updatedAt) + `by_teacherId` index; added `by_role` index on
    `users` for teacher lookup
  - `convex/subjects.ts` — `listAll` (subjects joined with teacher name),
    `getTeachers` (dropdown options), `create` / `update` / `remove`
    mutations; all write mutations gate on Dean identity; teacherId is
    verified against an existing `role=teacher` user; queries return a
    `{ ok, data } | { ok: false, error }` Result union (never throw)
  - `types/subjects.ts` (`Subject`, `SubjectListItem`, `SubjectFormValues`,
    `TeacherOption`, `RoomType`), `constants/subjects.ts` (`ROOM_TYPES`,
    `ROOM_TYPE_LABELS`), `lib/validation/subject.ts` (zod
    `subjectFormSchema`)
  - `lib/result.ts` — `Result<T>` union + `errorMessage` helper
  - `components/shared/EmptyState.tsx` and `components/shared/ErrorState.tsx`
    (Skeleton-based, per code-standards)
  - `hooks/useSubjects.ts` — one hook per page: subjects + teachers queries,
    `isLoading`/`isEmpty`/`error`, `addSubject`/`updateSubject`/`deleteSubject`
  - `components/subjects/SubjectManagement.tsx` (search, add/edit/delete
    wiring, table with Category badge column + icon actions, Skeletons),
    `SubjectFormDialog.tsx` (add/edit modal, zod validation, controlled Base
    UI selects), `SubjectDeleteDialog.tsx` (confirm + inline error)
  - `app/dean/subjects/page.tsx` now renders `<SubjectManagement />`
  - Fixed vendored `hooks/use-mobile.ts` `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
    lint error — rewrote with `useSyncExternalStore` (SSR-safe, no effect
    setState)
  - **Role claim fix** (teacher assignment was empty): Clerk's JWT carries
    the role at `metadata.role`, but Convex read `identity.role` (top-level)
    → `upsertUser` stored no role and `isDean` was false, so `listAll`/
    `getTeachers` returned empty and mutations threw Unauthorized. Added
    `convex/roles.ts` (`roleOf` reads `metadata.role ?? role`, `isDean`),
    used by `users.ts` and `subjects.ts`. Existing users re-patch their role
    on next `useUserSync` page load.
  - **Teacher sync from Clerk**: teacher dropdown was disabled because
    Convex `users` had no `role=teacher` rows unless the teacher had logged
    in after the role fix. Added `convex/teachers.ts` —
    `syncFromClerk` action calls the Clerk API (`users?limit=500`, paginated,
    filtered to `public_metadata.role === "teacher"`) and upserts them via
    `upsertTeacher`; set `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as a Convex deployment env var;
    `getTeachers` query + `listAll` teacher-name join moved to read Convex.
    `useSubjects` triggers the action once per session; teacher select is no
    longer disabled.
  - **Teacher names**: dropdown + subjects table display "First Last"
    from Clerk (`firstName`/`lastName`, email only as fallback);
    `scripts/seed-users.ts` now sets first/last names for the seeded
    accounts so Clerk always carries them (run against live Clerk).
  - Verified: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run build` passes
- **Dean Room CRUD (spec 03)** — full unit:
  - Added `rooms` table to `convex/schema.ts` (name, type
    `lecture|lab`, createdAt/updatedAt)
  - `convex/rooms.ts` — `listAll` (Result union), `create` / `update` /
    `remove` mutations; all write mutations gate on Dean identity
  - Moved `RoomType`/`ROOM_TYPES`/`ROOM_TYPE_LABELS` from
    `types/subjects.ts`+`constants/subjects.ts` into
    `types/rooms.ts`/`constants/rooms.ts` (deleted
    `constants/subjects.ts`); `subjects` now imports them from rooms
  - `types/rooms.ts` (`Room`, `RoomFormValues`),
    `lib/validation/room.ts` (zod `roomFormSchema`)
  - `hooks/useRooms.ts` — one hook per page: listAll query,
    `isLoading`/`isEmpty`/`error`, `addRoom`/`updateRoom`/`deleteRoom`
  - `components/rooms/RoomManagement.tsx` (search + add/edit/delete
    wiring, table with Category badge column + icon actions, Skeletons),
    `RoomFormDialog.tsx` (add/edit modal, zod validation, controlled
    Base UI select), `RoomDeleteDialog.tsx` (confirm + inline error)
  - `app/dean/rooms/page.tsx` now renders `<RoomManagement />`
  - **Subjects now select a real Room** (spec 03): `subjects.roomType`
    replaced with `subjects.roomId` (Convex `v.id("rooms")`); the
    subject form's hard-coded Lecture/Lab select is now a "Room" select
    populated from `api.rooms.listAll`; `listAll` joins rooms to expose
    `roomName`/`roomType`; create/update validate the room exists;
    `useSubjects` exposes `rooms` for the form; the subjects table shows
    the Category badge + connected room name and search covers it
  - Verified: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run build` passes
- **Legacy subjects schema fix (post spec 03)** — resolved, live:
  - Existing subject docs (created pre-spec-03) stored `roomType` and had
    no `roomId`, so Convex schema validation failed on every push
    (missing `roomId`; the extra `roomType` field was also rejected once
    `roomId` was optional). Fixed the stored data, not the code:
  - Added `convex/migrations.ts` — internal, idempotent
    `backfillSubjectRoomIds`: for each subject missing `roomId`, reuse an
    existing room of the subject's stale type or create a `Legacy
    <Type>` fallback room, then `ctx.db.replace` the doc with `roomId`
    (drops the stale `roomType`)
  - Ran it against dev (astute-akita-425): temporarily relaxed the
    schema (`roomId`/`roomType` optional) so the migration could deploy
    and run — the strict push would otherwise block on the invalid doc.
    After backfill (1 doc, `SE 101` → created `Legacy Lab`), restored
    the strict schema and re-pushed; validation now passes.
  - Verified `subjects` and `rooms` via `npx convex run --inline-query`
    (inline-query sandbox works if double quotes are written as single
    quotes in PowerShell 5.1, which otherwise strips `"` from native
    args); `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run build` passes
- **Teacher Availability (spec 04)** — full unit:
  - Installed shadcn `toggle`, `toggle-group`, `sonner` via CLI (deps
    added: `sonner`, `next-themes`)
  - Added `availability` table to `convex/schema.ts` (teacherId = Clerk
    user id, blockedSlots `string[]`, createdAt/updatedAt) +
    `by_teacherId` index
  - `convex/availability.ts` — `getMine` query + `setMine` mutation;
    both gate on teacher role (`roleOf`); `getMine` returns the doc's
    `blockedSlots` (or `[]`); `setMine` validates every slot key against
    known bounds (6 days × 12 slots) before upserting (insert or patch)
  - Slot keys are strings `"<dayIndex>-<timeIndex>"` — `0..5` =
    Mon–Sat, `0..11` = 7:30 AM–7:30 PM 60-min slots (bounds updated by the
    school-hours unit — the validator derives them from
    `constants/availability.ts` now, no plain-number copies)
  - `types/availability.ts` (`AvailabilityDay`, `AvailabilityTimeSlot`,
    `AvailabilitySlotKey`) + `constants/availability.ts`
    (`AVAILABILITY_DAYS`, `AVAILABILITY_TIME_SLOTS`,
    `availabilitySlotKey` / `parseAvailabilitySlotKey` /
    `availabilitySlotLabel`)
  - `hooks/useAvailability.ts` — one hook per page: `getMine` query,
    `isLoading`/`isEmpty`/`error`/`isSaving`, `save` mutation (stable
    `EMPTY_BLOCKED` reference so the page can hydrate draft without
    render loops)
  - `components/availability/AvailabilityGrid.tsx` (toggle grid via
    shadcn `Toggle` + `Tooltip` per cell, horizontally scrollable on
    small screens, `overflow-x-auto` + `min-w-[42rem]`),
    `AvailabilityGridSkeleton.tsx` (matching grid-shaped Skeletons),
    `AvailabilityPage.tsx` (page-level component: draft `Set` state
    hydrated once from the hook, Save persists full set, Reset reverts,
    sonner toasts, inline blocked-count summary, `ErrorState` retry)
  - **Sidebar refactor**: extracted shared `components/shared/AppSidebar.tsx`
    (takes `groups` prop) — `DeanSidebar` now wraps it with `DEAN_NAV`;
    added `components/TeacherSidebar.tsx` with `TEACHER_NAV`
    (Dashboard / Availability / My Schedule); no duplicated sidebar code
  - New routes: `APP_ROUTES.teacherAvailability` (`/teacher/availability`),
    `APP_ROUTES.teacherSchedule` (`/teacher/schedule`)
  - `app/teacher/layout.tsx` — `SidebarProvider` + `TeacherSidebar` +
    content column, `requireRole(ROLES.teacher)` (mirrors dean layout;
    plain `<div>` for content, no nested `<main>`)
  - `app/teacher/availability/page.tsx` renders `<AvailabilityPage />`;
    `app/teacher/schedule/page.tsx` is a `"use client"` placeholder
    (EmptyState) so the My Schedule nav link doesn't 404 (no real
    schedule yet)
  - Mounted `components/ui/sonner` `<Toaster position="top-right" />` in
    the root `app/layout.tsx` (inside the main column) for save/error
    toasts
  - Fixed runtime issue caught after build: passing a lucide icon
    component from a Server Component page into client `EmptyState` is
    not allowed (`Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components`)
    → schedule page is now a client component
  - Verified: `npm run lint` (0 errors — only pre-existing warnings in
    `convex/_generated/*` and `convex/auth.config.ts`), `npm run build`
    passes; `convex codegen` pushed the schema/functions to dev; ran
    `availability:getMine` (ok/empty unauthenticated) and
    `availability:setMine` (throws Unauthorized as expected) via
    `npx convex run`
- **Schedule Generation (spec 05)** — full unit:
  - Pure scheduling engine in `convex/scheduling/` (zero Convex imports,
    runs under plain `tsx`): `types.ts` (`SchedulingInput`, `PlacedSession`,
    `CspInfeasibleReason`, `CspResult`, `GaOptions`), `util.ts`
    (`intervalsOverlap`), `csp.ts` (`runCSP` backtracking search +
    `buildSessionUnits` + `greedyDecode` + `validateSchedulingInput`),
    `validate.ts` (`validateSolution` hard-constraint check), `ga.ts`
    (`runGA` permutation GA with greedy decode, valid-by-construction)
  - CSP decides the schedule (always runs). Hard constraints: no
    double-booked teacher, no double-booked room, room type must match the
    subject's room, subject never in a teacher-blocked slot, every subject
    placed exactly `meetingsPerWeek` sessions of `durationMinutes` each.
    Soft constraints (day spread, idle gaps, workload) are GA fitness only —
    not enforced by CSP.
  - Time model = the availability grid (Mon–Sat × 12 × 60-min, 7:30 AM–7:30 PM);
    `durationMinutes` must be a whole multiple of the 60-min slot
    (SE 101 = 180 min = 3 consecutive slots). Grid bounds come from
    `constants/availability.ts` only.
  - `convex/schema.ts`: new `schedules` table — one row per placed session
    (subjectId/Name, teacherId/Name, roomId/Name, roomType, dayIndex,
    startMinutes, endMinutes, createdAt/updatedAt) + `by_teacherId` index;
    an atomic snapshot — regenerating clears and rewrites all rows
  - `convex/schedule.ts`: `generate` action (Dean-gated) reads
    `rooms.listAll`/`subjects.listAll` queries + internal `listAvailability`,
    maps to a `SchedulingInput`, runs `runCSP`, defensively re-validates the
    result, then `saveGenerated` (internal mutation) clears old rows and
    inserts the new timetable in one transaction; returns
    `{ ok, count } | { ok: false, error }` (error = CSP infeasibility reason
    message). `listAll` query (Dean-gated, Result union) feeds the page.
  - `hooks/useSchedule.ts` — one hook per page: `listAll` query +
    `useAction(api.schedule.generate)`, `isLoading`/`isEmpty`/`error`/
    `isGenerating`/`generateError`/`generate`; sessions sorted Mon→Sat then
    by start time (`byTimeOfWeek`)
  - `types/schedule.ts` (`ScheduleSession`, `GenerateScheduleResult`),
    `constants/routes.ts` `APP_ROUTES.deanSchedule` (`/dean/schedule`),
    DeanSidebar "Generate Schedule" item (CalendarCog, Manage group)
  - `components/schedule/ScheduleTable.tsx` (Subject / Teacher / Room + type
    Badge / Day / Time via `AVAILABILITY_DAYS` + `formatClock`),
    `ScheduleTableSkeleton.tsx`, `SchedulePage.tsx` (loading → skeleton,
    query error → `ErrorState` + reload retry, generate failure →
    `ErrorState` retry = re-generate, empty → `EmptyState` + Generate button,
    else table; sonner success/error toasts; spinner while generating);
    `app/dean/schedule/page.tsx` renders `<SchedulePage />`
  - Fixed along the way: `constants/availability.ts` now imports
    `types/availability` relatively (Convex's tscc can't resolve `@/` inside
    `convex/`-imported files); explicit result type annotations in `generate`
    to break TS weather inference circularity on same-module helpers
  - Verification: `scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` (`npx tsx`) — 14/14
    assertions: feasible case (8 sessions, zero violations), GA output stays
    valid vs CSP seed, blocked-slot respect, capacity overflow →
    `exhausted`, non-multiple-of-60 → `invalid-duration`, fully-blocked
    teacher, empty rooms, plus a case mirroring live dev data (SE 101
    180-min lab ×2 in `IT Lab 1`, no availability → exactly 2 sessions, zero
    violations). Root `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` (0 errors),
    `npm run build` passes (`/dean/schedule` routed); `convex codegen`
    pushed functions to dev, where an unauthenticated
    `schedule:generate` throws `Unauthorized` and `schedule:listAll` returns
    `{ ok: true, data: [] }`
- **Fixed Day-Pair Scheduling (MW / TTh)** — full unit:
  - `constants/dayPatterns.ts` — single source for `DayPattern` (`"MW" |
    "TTh"`), `DAY_PATTERNS`, `DAY_PATTERN_OPTIONS`, `DAY_PATTERN_LABELS`
    ("MW (Mon & Wed)" / "TTh (Tue & Thu)"), and
    `DAY_PATTERN_DAY_INDEXES` (`MW = [0, 2]`, `TTh = [1, 3]` on the
    Mon=0…Sat=5 grid). **No imports** — the Convex-side compiler can't
    resolve `@/`, so the engine files import it relatively
    (`../../constants/dayPatterns`).
  - `types/subjects.ts` + `lib/validation/subject.ts`: `meetingsPerWeek`
    → `dayPattern` (required, zod `z.enum(["MW","TTh"])`).
  - `convex/scheduling/types.ts`: subject now carries `dayPattern`;
    `PlacedSession.meetingIndex` removed; `invalid-meetings` reason
    replaced by `invalid-pattern`.
  - `convex/scheduling/csp.ts` rewritten to the pair model:
    `expandSubjectsIntoSessions` emits exactly 2 fixed-day sessions per
    subject whose candidate slots are times the teacher is free on **both**
    pattern days; `runCSP` places/unplaces the pair atomically. Day is now
    an input, not a choice — the CSP solves only the time (room and day
    come from the subject/pattern).
  - `convex/scheduling/validate.ts`: pair invariants — exactly 2 sessions,
    correct pattern days, same time, same room; keeps teacher/room
    double-book, room type, blocked-slot, and bounds checks.
  - `convex/scheduling/ga.ts`: chromosome is now a permutation of
    **subject-pair units** (decode moves pairs atomically); removed the
    per-subject day-spread penalty that no longer applies. Still standalone
    / not wired into `generate`.
  - `convex/schedule.ts`: `SubjectRow` gains required `dayPattern`; passes
    straight into `SchedulingSubject`.
  - `convex/schema.ts` → `convex/migrations.ts`: added
    `backfillSubjectDayPatterns` (internal, idempotent: legacy docs →
    `dayPattern: "MW"`, strips `meetingsPerWeek`); `backfillSubjectRoomIds`
    replace shape updated. Ran through the same **relaxed → migrate →
    strict** window as the spec-03 backfill; dev now has 3 subjects, all
    `dayPattern: "MW"`, no `meetingsPerWeek` field.
  - `convex/subjects.ts`: `subjectFields` validator + create/update write
    `dayPattern`.
  - `components/subjects/SubjectFormDialog.tsx`: meetings number input →
    day-pattern `Select` (options from `DAY_PATTERN_LABELS`);
    `components/subjects/SubjectManagement.tsx`: "Meetings" → "Schedule
    Pattern" column (both skeleton + data) rendering a `Badge` with the
    pattern; search covers the pattern too. (Note: the sub-table lives
    inline in `SubjectManagement.tsx` — there is no
    `components/subjects/SubjectsTable.tsx`.)
  - `components/schedule/ScheduleTable.tsx`: one **grouped row per
    subject** with a "Schedule Pattern" column (badge + "Mon & Wed" /
    "Tue & Thu" via `DAY_PATTERNS`); clean pairs collapse to a single row,
    non-clean pairs fall back to per-session rows. Column layout matched
    dev data (all MW subjects) and follows `component/table` — `ui-context.md`
    is an unfilled template with no table guidance, so per-session rows +
    grouping was chosen by me and should be sanity-checked in the browser.
  - `components/schedule/ScheduleTableSkeleton.tsx`: header + skeleton
    cells updated for the pattern column.
  - `scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` rewritten for the paired model:
    **26/26 assertions** (`npx tsx`) — feasible case (6 sessions, 6 hard
    constraints), per-pattern pair integrity (same time + same room, days
    [0,2] / [1,3]), blocked-on-either-day forces the pair to slot 9, GA
    validity + pair integrity, 11 TTh subjects → `exhausted`,
    invalid-duration, invalid-pattern, SE 101 3-hr lab mirror, the **full
    dev seed (3 MW labs, one teacher)** yielding 6 linked sessions with
    zero teacher double-books, blocked-teacher → `no-slot-fits`, empty
    rooms → `no-rooms`.
  - Migration + verification: pushed the relaxed schema, ran
    `backfillSubjectDayPatterns` (3 backfilled), restored the strict
    schema, re-pushed. Verified via inline-query that every subject doc has
    `dayPattern` and no `meetingsPerWeek`; unauthenticated
    `schedule:generate` still throws `Unauthorized`; `schedule:listAll` /
    `subjects:listAll` return `{ ok: true, data: [] }` (listAll is
    role-scoped — populated only for the owner/login). Root `npx tsc
    --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` (0 errors — same pre-existing
    warnings), `npm run build` passes.
- One transient fix during the migration window: `schedule.ts`'s
     `SubjectRow.dayPattern` was made optional while the relaxed schema made
     `listAll` return `dayPattern?`; re-tightened to required after the
     strict re-push.
- **School Hours 7:30 AM–7:30 PM + Detailed Infeasibility Reasons** — full
  unit:
  - **Hours single-sourced**: `constants/availability.ts` now defines
    `AVAILABILITY_START_MINUTES = 7 * 60 + 30` (7:30 AM) and
    `AVAILABILITY_END_MINUTES = 19 * 60 + 30` (7:30 PM); slots stay 60-min
    → the grid is now 12 slots/day (7:30 AM–6:30 PM slots) instead of 10.
    This is the one source of the bounds; `csp.ts`/`ga.ts`/`validate.ts`/
    `cspDiagnostics.ts` read the grid from `input.timeSlots`, which
    `convex/schedule.ts` builds from the same constants.
  - **Validator synced to the source**: `convex/availability.ts` replaced its
    hardcoded `DAY_COUNT = 6` / `TIME_SLOT_COUNT = 10` with
    `AVAILABILITY_DAYS.length` / `AVAILABILITY_TIME_SLOTS.length` (now 12),
    so out-of-range slot keys ("stray" data outside 7:30 AM–7:30 PM) are
    rejected against the true bounds.
  - `AvailabilityGrid`/`AvailabilityGridSkeleton` derive rows/columns from
    the same constants (6 days × 12 slots) — skeleton no longer has a
    hardcoded 60-cell count.
  - **Detailed diagnostics**: new `convex/scheduling/cspDiagnostics.ts`
    (renamed from a hyphenated filename — Convex module paths reject `-`)
    with `explainInfeasibility(subject, input, placedSessions)` returning a
    structured `InfeasibilityReason` (`subjectName`, `dayPattern`,
    `durationMinutes`, `day1FreeWindows`, `day2FreeWindows`,
    `cause`, `message`) per failed subject. Teacher free windows are the
    maximal contiguous free runs (blocked slots minus other placed sessions
    of the same teacher) long enough to fit the duration, within school
    hours. Cause is `no-shared-teacher-window` (no start free on both
    pattern days), `no-room-available` (shared starts exist but the assigned
    room is occupied at all of them), or `unknown`.
  - `convex/scheduling/types.ts`: `CspResult` failure now carries
    `reasons: readonly InfeasibilityReason[]` for placement failures; the
    `no-slot-fits` and `exhausted` codes were removed (single
    `CspInfeasibleReason` remains for config errors: no-subjects, no-rooms,
    invalid-pattern, invalid-duration, no-matching-room).
  - `csp.ts`: `expandSubjectsIntoSessions` no longer fails fast on the first
    teacher-blocked subject — it collects one reason per subject with no
    shared window; `runCSP` returns those reasons, and on a backtracking
    `MAX_ATTEMPTS`/exhausted failure returns per-subject reasons from
    `diagnoseFailedPlacement` (a greedy pass in the same unit order that
    explains each subject that collides with the rest). Shared helpers
    `blockedByDayFor`/`intervalsOverlap` moved to `util.ts` (also used by
    `validate.ts` — removed its duplicate).
  - `convex/schedule.ts` `generate` returns `{ ok: false, error,
    infeasibleSubjects }` (the structured reasons array) instead of a single
    string; generic config errors still return just `{ ok: false, error }`.
    `types/schedule.ts` + `hooks/useSchedule.ts` mirror it
    (`generateError` + `infeasibleSubjects`).
  - **UI**: new `components/schedule/ScheduleGenerationError.tsx` — a richer
    error state using the shared ErrorState tokens (Skeleton icon, muted
    card, retry button) that lists each failed subject in a shadcn
    `accordion` (installed via CLI; Base UI) with subject name + day-pattern
    badge + minutes, the structured cause label, the plain-language
    `message`, and the free windows per pattern day formatted via
    `formatClock` ("7:30 AM–8:30 AM"). One subject is open by default.
    `SchedulePage` renders it when `infeasibleSubjects` is present, else the
    plain `ErrorState`.
  - `scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` rebuilt on the new 7:30 AM–7:30 PM
    grid (derived from `AVAILABILITY_TIME_SLOTS`, not hand-counted) —
    **33/33 assertions**: existing coverage plus new diagnostic tests —
    no-shared-window across Mon/Wed (asserts the exact free windows and
    cause), room-caused distinction (two subjects sharing one room, teacher
    free on both days, room taken at every shared start → `no-room-available`
    on the blocked subject), and 13-subject one-room overflow →
    `no-room-available`.
  - Verified: `npx tsx scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` (33/33), root
    `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` (0 errors — same pre-existing
    warnings), `npm run build` passes, `npx convex codegen` pushes cleanly.
  - Note: this project's slot step is 60 minutes, not the 30 the change
    brief assumed; left at 60 (the brief's "leave as-is unless runtime is
    excessive" — it isn't; the 13-subject overflow resolves instantly).
- **Teacher Availability by Day-Pair (spec 06)** — full unit:
  - Availability is entered once per day-pair, not per individual day:
    `AvailabilityGrid.tsx` is now a **2-column** grid ("Mon & Wed" / "Tue &
    Thu" with the `MW` / `TTh` code beneath), each toggle applies to both days
    of the pair; `AvailabilityGridSkeleton.tsx` mirrors the 2 columns;
    `AvailabilityPage` toggles by `(dayPattern, timeSlotIndex)` and counts
    `2 × 12` slots; the page/empty-state copy explains that a block covers
    both days.
  - **Blocked cells are now red** (`bg-destructive` +
    `text-destructive-foreground`) instead of the green accent. Added
    `--destructive-foreground` (light/dark) to `globals.css` + mapped it in
    `@theme inline`. Rationale: blocked = unavailable = the destructive
    semantic, and it visually separates availability from the sidebar's green
    accent.
  - Slot keys changed from `"<dayIndex>-<timeIndex>"` to
    `"<pattern>-<timeIndex>"` (`MW-0`, `TTh-11`): `constants/availability.ts`
    now exports `availabilityPatternKey` / `parseAvailabilityPatternKey` /
    `availabilityPatternSlotLabel` / `areaPatternLabel`, and
    `AVAILABILITY_PATTERNS` = `DAY_PATTERN_OPTIONS`. It imports only types +
    the import-free `constants/dayPatterns.ts`, so Convex's tscc still
    resolves it. `convex/availability.ts`'s validator is now just "string
    parses via `parseAvailabilityPatternKey`" (bounds included).
  - Engine consumes patterns: `SchedulingAvailability.blockedByDay` →
    `blockedByPattern: { dayPattern, slotIndexes }[]`
    (`convex/scheduling/types.ts`); `convex/scheduling/util.ts`
    `blockedByDayFor` resolves each pattern's blocks onto **both** of its
    days, so the two days of a pair always carry identical blocks and a
    Mon-vs-Wed (or Tue-vs-Thu) availability mismatch is structurally
    impossible to express. `csp.ts`/`validate.ts`/`cspDiagnostics.ts`
    unchanged apart from the util helper — they read the resolved day map.
    The `no-shared-teacher-window` cause can now only come from per-day
    placed-session differences or a fully-blocked pattern (diagnostic
    docstring updated). `convex/schedule.ts` `buildSchedulingInput` parses
    the new keys into `blockedByPattern`.
  - Migration `backfillAvailabilityDayPairs` (internal, idempotent) converts
    legacy `"<day>-<slot>"` keys to pattern keys with **union** semantics (a
    time is blocked on the pair if it was blocked on EITHER day — the
    conservative choice; flagged in Open Questions). Ran against dev: 1 doc
    converted; a second run returns 0 (idempotent). No relaxed-schema window
    was needed — the `availability` table shape (`blockedSlots: string[]`) is
    unchanged, only the key format differs.
  - Smoke test rebuilt for patterns: **35/35 assertions** — fixtures use
    `blockedByPattern`; "MW slots 0-8 blocked → pair to slot 9" kept; the old
    Mon-freely/Wed-busy mismatch case (now unexpressible) was replaced by a
    structural test asserting free windows are identical on both pattern days
    (`freeWindowsForDay`, slot 0 = 7:30–8:30 AM) plus a fully-blocked-pattern
    `no-shared-teacher-window` case with empty windows on both days.
  - Verified: `npx tsx scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts` (35/35), root
    `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` (0 errors — same pre-existing
    warnings), `npm run build` passes, `npx convex codegen` pushed cleanly.
  - Note: Friday/Saturday were days on the old grid but can't hold any class
    today (patterns only cover Mon-Wed / Tue-Thu), so the availability UI no
    longer offers them (see Open Questions).

## In Progress

- None. Schedule Generation unit remains complete (CSP wired; GA not yet
  wired).

## Next Up

1. Teacher My Schedule view (real, read-only, not placeholder) — consumes
   the generated `schedules` rows filtered by teacher id
2. Dean schedule view polish / student-facing schedule (out of scope until
   confirmed in specs)
3. (Optional, later) Wire `runGA` into the `generate` action once soft
   constraints come in scope — `convex/scheduling/ga.ts` is already built,
   standalone-tested (pair-atom chromosomes), and left with a clear call
   site
4. Sanity-check the 2-column availability grid in the browser (real teacher
   login): red blocked cells, save/reset round-trip, tooltip labels — the
   pattern keys and grid are covered by lint/build/smoke, but the visual/UX
   hasn't been eyeballed
5. Sanity-check the `ScheduleGenerationError` accordion in the browser
   (real Dean, school-hours blocks) — the engine diagnostics and the UI
   state machine are verified by the smoke test + build, but a live generate
   failure hasn't been eyeballed.

## Open Questions

- ~~The exact availability time blocks were not defined in
  `project-overview.md` / `architecture.md`.~~ Resolved by spec 05 and the
  school-hours unit: the generator consumes the Mon–Sat × 12 × 1-hour grid
  (7:30 AM–7:30 PM, 60-min slots) from `constants/availability.ts` as the
  single source. One consequence: a subject's `durationMinutes` must be a
  whole multiple of the 60-min slot (SE 101 = 180 min = 3 consecutive
  slots). If non-aligned durations or half-hour slots are ever wanted, the
  grid and the CSP must change together.
- Generated schedules are an atomic snapshot: each `schedules` row
  denormalizes subject/teacher/room names at generation time, so editing a
  Subject's name or a Room's name does not rewrite an already-generated
  timetable (it will be refreshed next regenerate). Confirm this snapshot
  semantics is what we want, or join names live and drop the denormalized
  fields.
- Each Subject carries a single fixed `roomId` (spec 03 data model), so
  "room type matches subject" reduces to scheduling in the Dean-chosen
  room. If a subject should instead be placeable in *any* room of a type,
  the schema would expose `roomType` on the subject and the CSP's room
  candidates would widen — decide before extending the scheduler.
- Dev seed data only has lab rooms (IT Lab 1–3) and three subjects
  (SE 101 → IT Lab 1 180 min, HCI 101 → IT Lab 2 120 min, OS 101 → IT Lab 3
  180 min; one teacher, availability unset) with no `dayPattern` on the
  subject. Generating over the empty availability set works and yields 6
  linked sessions, all landing on MW by default
  (matches the backfilled schedule rows), with no teacher double-books
  (verified) — but a typical timetable needs the Dean to add lecture
  rooms/subjects and teachers to set availability first.
- **Day patterns beyond MW/TTh**: today a subject must meet twice on a
  contiguous Mon-Wed or Tue-Thu pair. The user's example key was `TTH`
  (reconciled to `TTh` to match the required union `"MW" | "TTh"`). Later
  patterns (e.g. a Friday-only lab, or M/W/F) would extend
  `DAY_PATTERN_DAY_INDEXES` / the union and relax the "exactly 2 sessions"
  assumption in `expandSubjectsIntoSessions` and `validate.ts` — and, since
  spec 06, the availability model is pattern-shaped too (a new pattern would
  need a grid column + key prefix). Decide whether the pattern set should
  stay closed.
- **Migration semantics for the one converted availability doc**: spec 06's
  `backfillAvailabilityDayPairs` used **union** (a pair-slot is blocked if it
  was blocked on EITHER of the two days), the conservative choice that never
  schedules a teacher in time they'd blocked on any day. The spec suggested
  intersection instead (only block what's blocked on both days) — I chose
  union and flagged it: switch only if deliberate, and note the migration
  is idempotent (a second run reports 0), so an intersection change needs a
  manual re-run or a new migration.
- **Friday / Saturday dropped from the availability grid**: with per-pattern
  availability there is no Mon..Sat day grid anymore — only the MW and TTh
  pair columns. That's correct today because subjects can only be MW/TTh, but
  any future Fri/Sat scheduling (or a "stack a subject on both days of a
  pattern plus a Friday lab") needs both a new day-pattern and a wider
  availability model.
- **Do any subjects legitimately need DIFFERENT times on their two pattern
  days?** If yes, the linked-pair-at-same-time assumption (day-pair scheduling
  from the Fixed Day-Pair unit) and this per-pattern availability model both
  unravel — revisit before extending the scheduler in any direction.
- (Resolved) The subject-level `dayPattern` input is gone entirely
  (Algorithm-Chooses-the-Pattern unit): the `backfillSubjectDayPatterns`
  migration and its `PrePatternSubject` default-to-MW question are obsolete.
  The chosen pattern now lives on schedule rows as an output, so Dean input
  can't drift from what the algorithm actually scheduled.
- The schedule table groups a subject's two sessions into one row with a
  pattern badge (clean pair) and falls back to per-session rows otherwise.
  `ui-context.md` is an unfilled template (no table guidance), so this is
  a judgment call — sanity-check the grouping/badge in the browser before
  it becomes convention.
- Spec 04 references a "dark green accent token" for sidebar active
  state. Introduced `--accent-primary` (+ `--accent-primary-foreground`)
  in `globals.css` (mapped in `@theme inline` as
  `--color-accent-primary*`). The availability grid's blocked cells **no
  longer use it** — spec 06 switched them to the red `destructive` token
  (`--color-destructive` + new `--color-destructive-foreground`), so
  `--accent-primary` is now used by nothing app-side except the sidebar
  styling decision below. Teacher sidebar still mirrors the Dean sidebar
  styling — decide whether to migrate both sidebars to the green accent.
  Registered here rather than invented.
- `/teacher/schedule` ("My Schedule") is a placeholder page with a real
  schedule source now available (`schedules` table, `by_teacherId`
  index) — building the read-only teacher view is the next unit.
- The antd/shadcn split: existing dashboard components
  (`DeanDashboard`, `TeacherDashboard`, `AppHeader`, root antd
  `ConfigProvider`) still use antd, while new UI (DeanSidebar, Subject
  Management, Room Management, Teacher availability) uses shadcn. Decide
  when/how to migrate the remaining antd components to shadcn, or keep
  antd for them.
- Deleting a Room that is still referenced by Subjects: subjects always
  carry a `roomId` (strict schema), so deleting a referenced room leaves
  subjects pointing at a missing room (rendered as `—`). Decide whether
  Room delete should be blocked while subjects reference the room, or
  clear/reassign those subjects on delete.
- The `Legacy Lab`/`Legacy Lecture` fallback rooms created by
  `convex/migrations.ts` are editable/deletable from the Dean room UI —
  re-assign/move the `SE 101` subject first if the fallback room is
  deleted.

## Architecture Decisions

- Taskbar uses shadcn sidebar + lucide-react icons (per spec).
- Routes live in `constants/routes.ts` only (`APP_ROUTES.deanRooms`,
  `APP_ROUTES.deanSubjects`) — no raw path strings (Invariant 2).
- Dean routes are guarded once in `app/dean/layout.tsx` via
  `requireRole(ROLES.dean)` (middleware/role logic still centralized in
  `hooks/useAuth.ts`).
- Single source for top-chrome height: `--app-header-height` CSS
  variable set on `<body>` in the root layout; the Dean sidebar's fixed
  panel spans `top: var(--app-header-height)` → viewport bottom so it
  sits below the sticky white AppHeader instead of overlapping it.
- Subject management queries (`listAll`, `getTeachers`) return a
  `{ ok, data } | { ok: false, error }` Result union instead of throwing,
  so `useSubjects` can surface failed queries to the error state without
  relying on an error boundary. Mutations still throw and are caught in
  the dialog components.
- Subjects reference their assigned teacher by the teacher's Clerk user
  id (`teacherId`), matching how `users`/availability are keyed — never by
  name (Invariant 3). Display names are resolved at query time.
- Teacher accounts for the Dean's dropdown are sourced from Clerk
  (`convex/teachers.ts` `syncFromClerk` action), pulled on page load once
  per session and upserted into Convex; the dropdown then reads Convex
  reactively. Requires `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` as a Convex deployment env.
- Subject "category" is derived from the room a subject is assigned to:
  `subjects.roomId` points at a `rooms` document and the table's Category
  badge shows the room's `Lecture`/`Lab` type (+ name). Per spec 03, the
  subject form no longer picks a hard-coded type — it picks an actual
  room from the rooms table.
- `useSubjects` is the single hook for the page; search filtering is
  transient UI state kept in `SubjectManagement` (useMemo), not in Convex.
- Subject category/room type now lives on the `rooms` table
  (`convex/schema.ts`); `subjects.roomId` references the room by Convex
  `Id`, and `roomName`/`roomType` are joined at query time (mirrors how
  `teacherId` is joined to teacher names). `RoomType` and its constants
  are owned by the rooms module (`types/rooms.ts`, `constants/rooms.ts`)
  and imported by subjects.
- `useRooms` mirrors `useSubjects`: single hook per page, Result-union
  `listAll` query, throw-and-catch mutations in the dialog components,
  Skeleton-based loading/empty/error states.
- Availability is stored as one doc per teacher (`availability` table,
  indexed by Clerk `userId`); `blockedSlots` is the full set of
  `"<dayPattern>-<timeIndex>"` keys (`MW-0`, `TTh-11`). Grid edits are kept
  as local draft state; **Save** writes the whole array (upsert: insert or
  patch) and **Reset** reverts to the last saved set — an atomic write avoids
  many small per-cell document churn.
- `getMine`/`setMine` gate on the teacher role (`roleOf`). `getMine`
  returns `{ ok: true, data: [] }` for non-teachers rather than throwing
  (mirrors `rooms.listAll`); `setMine` throws `Unauthorized` and also
  rejects any slot key outside the 2 patterns × 12 slots (7:30 AM–7:30 PM)
  bounds, parsed via the shared `parseAvailabilityPatternKey`.
- Sidebar is now generic: `components/shared/AppSidebar.tsx` takes a
  `groups` prop; `DeanSidebar` and `TeacherSidebar` are thin wrappers
  supplying their own nav configs from `APP_ROUTES` (no raw path
  strings).
- The availability "empty" state (no blocked slots) is rendered as an
  inline hint above the grid rather than replacing the grid with
  `EmptyState`, because the grid is always interactive even when every
  cell is available — a full EmptyState swap would prevent marking slots.
- The scheduling engine lives in `convex/scheduling/` as pure TypeScript
  with no Convex imports, so the same CSP/GA/validator code can be driven
  by a standalone script (`scripts/scheduling-smoke-test.ts`) and executed
  in a Convex action (`convex/schedule.ts`). CSP is the production path;
  GA stays out of the wiring until soft constraints are in scope.
- Schedules are written as an atomic snapshot: `generate` clears the
  `schedules` table and inserts every session in one internal mutation,
  so the UI never sees a half-generated timetable.
- The clock/grid model is single-sourced: `constants/availability.ts`
  defines the 7:30 AM–7:30 PM school hours (`AVAILABILITY_START_MINUTES`/
  `AVAILABILITY_END_MINUTES`, 60-min slots → 12 slots/day) and is used by
  the UI, the availability grid, and via `formatClock`/`AVAILABILITY_DAYS`
  by the schedule tables. `convex/scheduling/*` derives its bounds purely
  from the grid (`input.timeSlots`) built from those same constants, and
  `convex/availability.ts`'s validator imports the constants directly —
  no plain-number copies to drift.
- Placement-failure reporting is structured: `CspResult` failures carry one
  `InfeasibilityReason` per unplaceable subject (cause
  `no-shared-teacher-window` / `no-room-available` / `unknown`, the teacher's
  free windows per pattern day, and a plain-language message), produced by
  `convex/scheduling/cspDiagnostics.ts`. Config-level failures (no rooms,
  invalid duration/pattern, missing room) still return a single reason.
- Dean-only reads/writes of schedule data, availability data, subjects,
  and rooms all gate on `roleOf`/`isDean` (Dean) or teacher role,
  including the `generate` action (throws `Unauthorized` for anonymous and
  non-Dean callers).
- Day patterns are a closed vocabulary (`dayPattern: "MW" | "TTh"`),
  single-sourced in `constants/dayPatterns.ts` including the day indexes
  (`MW = [0, 2]`, `TTh = [1, 3]`) on the shared Mon=0…Sat=5 grid.
  That file has **no imports** so the Convex-side compiler (which can't
  resolve `@/`) can consume it; the scheduling engine imports it
  relatively. The pattern is an **algorithm output** — `PlacedSession` and
  `schedules` rows carry it; the subject no longer stores it.
- The day pattern is now a CSP choice: `expandSubjectsIntoSessions` builds a
  per-subject domain with one **linked pair** option per pattern (same time +
  same room on both pattern days — MW option first, then TTh). The pair
  stays atomic (place/unplace both days together; candidates require the
  teacher free on *both* days), but the CSP now also picks *which* pattern,
  preferring MW and falling back to TTh when MW is fully blocked. A subject
  is infeasible only when both options have zero candidates.
- **Availability is pattern-level, not day-level** (spec 06): the teacher
  blocks time once per day-pair. The grid/UI has 2 columns (MW, TTh), the
  Convex docs store `"<pattern>-<slot>"` keys but keep the same
  `availability` table shape, and the engine's `SchedulingAvailability`
  carries `blockedByPattern`, which `blockedByDayFor` fans out to both days
  of each pair. Both days of a pair always carry identical blocks, so a
  Mon-vs-Wed (or Tue-vs-Thu) availability mismatch is **structurally
  impossible** — the CSP's `no-shared-teacher-window` cause can only fire
  from per-day placed-session differences or a fully-blocked pattern now.
- **Blocked/unavailable cells use the red `destructive` token**, not the
  green accent (`bg-destructive` + `text-destructive-foreground`, with a new
  `--destructive-foreground` var in both themes). Rationale: "unavailable" is
  the destructive semantic and reads clearly as "the scheduler will avoid
  this"; the green `--accent-primary` accent stays for sidebar active states.
- The GA chromosome is a permutation of subject-pair units, so crossover /
  mutation can never break a day-pair; the old per-subject day-spread
  penalty was dropped because the spread is now fixed by the pattern.
  The GA now locks in the CSP's choice: each unit adopts the seed
  solution's pattern for that subject (domain option match, first as
  fallback), so decode output always matches what the CSP selected.
- Schema-evolution playbook (reused from spec 03): to migrate a field
  live, relax the schema (`v.optional`), deploy + run the idempotent
  internal backfill mutation, then restore the strict schema and re-push.
  This CLI (Convex 1.46) has **no `schema:push --relax`**, so the window is
  expressed directly in `convex/schema.ts` (make the changed columns
  optional, push, migrate, then finalize and push again). This unit ran
  `backfillSubjectRemoveDayPattern` (3 subjects) and
  `backfillScheduleDayPatterns` (6 existing schedule rows) inside that
  window; earlier units ran `backfillSubjectDayPatterns` (3 docs,
  since removed) and `backfillAvailabilityDayPairs` (1 doc).
- The schedule table collapses a clean pair into one row per subject with a
  "Schedule Pattern" badge + human label; a non-clean pair (shouldn't
  happen via `generate`) falls back to per-session rows.

## Session Notes

- shadcn style: `base-nova`, primitive base: `@base-ui/react`, icons:
  `lucide-react`, Tailwind v4. All `components/ui/*` are vendored.
- `app/dean/layout.tsx` uses a plain `<div>` for content (not
  `SidebarInset`, which renders a nested `<main>` making invalid HTML
  inside the root layout's `<main>`).
- Spec: `context/spec/01-design-taskbar-for-teacher.md`
- Spec: `context/spec/02-subject-management.md` (Dean Subject CRUD)
- Spec: `context/spec/03-room-management.md` (Dean Room CRUD + subject
  room selection)
- Spec: `context/spec/04-teacher-availability.md` (Teacher Availability
  + Teacher sidebar)
- Spec: `context/spec/05-teacher-generate-sched.md` (Generate Schedule —
  CSP engine wired via Convex action; GA built, not wired)
- Spec: `context/spec/06-teacher-availability-fix.md` (Teacher Availability
  by Day-Pair — MW/TTh grid, pattern-based availability model, red blocked
  cells)
- Unit: Fixed Day-Pair Scheduling (MW / TTh) — extended spec 05's engine
  from `meetingsPerWeek` to linked `dayPattern` pairs (see Completed)
- Unit: Teacher Availability by Day-Pair (MW / TTh) — spec 06; ran
  `npx convex run 'migrations:backfillAvailabilityDayPairs'` → converted 1
  legacy per-day availability doc (union semantics); a second run returns 0.
  No schema relaxation needed (the `availability` doc shape is unchanged).
- Unit: The Algorithm Chooses the Day Pattern (MW / TTh) — see Completed.
  Dev migration ran in a schema window (no `schema:push --relax` in this
  CLI): made `dayPattern` optional on both `subjects` and `schedules`, pushed
  with `npx convex dev --once` (also pushed the engine + regen'd `_generated`
  with the code), ran `npx convex run 'migrations:backfillSubjectRemoveDayPattern'`
  (cleaned 3) and `npx convex run 'migrations:backfillScheduleDayPatterns'`
  (backfilled 6 — all MW, consistent with their day indexes 0,2), then
  reverted the schema to final and pushed again. Verified with
  `npx convex data subjects` / `npx convex data schedules` that subjects have
  no `dayPattern` and all schedule rows do. Note: with
  `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` set, `npx convex deploy` targets the project's default
  *production* deployment — dev pushes must go through `convex dev --once`.
- PowerShell 5.1 caveat: to pass double quotes through `npx convex run
  --inline-query`, write the inner strings with doubled single quotes
  (`query(''rooms'')`), since PS otherwise strips `"` from native args.
  Note: the `--inline-query` sandbox forms touched this session
  (`(q) => q.query(...)`, `query(...).collect()`, `(ctx) => ctx.db...`)
  failed server-side in this Convex version, so migrations and data checks
  were verified via their `{ cleaned }` / `{ backfilled }` results +
  `convex data` instead.
