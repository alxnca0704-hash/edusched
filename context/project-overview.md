# Dean–Teacher Room & Subject Scheduler

## Overview

This is a prototype scheduling application that helps a school Dean generate a conflict-free class timetable automatically instead of building it by hand. The Dean enters the rooms available and the subjects that need to be scheduled (including how long and how often each meets, and who teaches it), while Teachers log in and set the times they are unavailable. Authentication is handled by Clerk, with Dean and Teacher accounts seeded manually ahead of time rather than through a public sign-up flow. Data (Rooms, Subjects, Availability, Schedules) is stored and synced in real time using Convex. A scheduling algorithm (Constraint Satisfaction, with Genetic Algorithm optimization planned for later) then assigns each subject a day, time, and room with no double-booked teachers or rooms.

## Goals

1. Let a Dean fully manage Room and Subject data through a working CRUD interface backed by Convex
2. Let a Teacher log in, set availability, and view their own generated schedule
3. Prove the core UX flow — login → data entry → availability input → generate schedule → view result — using seeded Clerk accounts and real persisted data in Convex
4. Keep the architecture simple enough to plug in a real CSP/GA scheduling engine later without redesigning the UI or data model

## Core User Flow

1. Dean or Teacher logs in with a Clerk account that was seeded ahead of time (no self-registration)
2. User is routed to their dashboard based on their role (Dean or Teacher), set via Clerk metadata
3. **Dean:** adds Rooms (name, type) — saved to Convex
4. **Dean:** adds Subjects (name, duration, day pattern MW or TTh, assigned teacher + room — pulled from seeded Clerk teacher accounts and the rooms table) — saved to Convex
5. **Teacher:** logs in and marks unavailable days/times — saved to Convex, linked to their Clerk user ID
6. **Dean:** clicks "Generate Schedule"
7. System reads Rooms, Subjects, and Availability from Convex, runs the scheduling logic, and writes the resulting schedule back to Convex
8. **Dean:** views the full generated schedule in a table/calendar, loaded live from Convex
9. **Teacher:** views only their own assigned classes in a filtered, read-only schedule, loaded live from Convex

## Features

### Authentication (Clerk, seeded accounts)

- Dean and Teacher accounts are created manually in Clerk ahead of time — no public sign-up page
- Role (Dean/Teacher) is stored in Clerk user metadata and used to route each user to the correct dashboard
- Clerk user ID is used as the link between a logged-in Teacher and their Convex records (availability, assigned schedule)

### Data Layer (Convex)

- Rooms, Subjects, Availability, and generated Schedule are stored as Convex tables
- Convex queries/mutations power all CRUD operations and keep the UI in sync in real time
- Seeded teacher accounts (from Clerk) automatically populate the Dean's "Assigned Teacher" dropdown when creating Subjects

### Room Management (Dean)

- Add, view, edit, and delete rooms
- Each room has a name and type (Lecture/Lab)

### Subject Management (Dean)

- Add, view, edit, and delete subjects
- Each subject has a name, session duration, a day pattern (MW = Mon &
  Wed, TTh = Tue & Thu — the subject meets twice a week on those days), an
  assigned room, and one assigned teacher
- Dean does not set the day/time/room of each session directly — that is
  decided by the scheduling algorithm (the pattern fixes *which* two days;
  the algorithm picks the time, applied identically on both days)

### Schedule Generation (Dean)

- One-click action to generate a full timetable from current Rooms, Subjects, and Teacher availability
- Displays the resulting schedule in a read-only table view

### Availability (Teacher)

- Weekly grid where a logged-in teacher marks blocked (unavailable) time slots
- Saved to Convex, linked to their Clerk user ID

### My Schedule (Teacher)

- Read-only view showing only the subjects/sessions assigned to the logged-in teacher
- Displays subject, day, time, and room

## Scope

### In Scope

- Clerk authentication with manually seeded Dean and Teacher accounts
- Role-based routing (Dean vs Teacher dashboard)
- Convex-backed data storage for Rooms, Subjects, Availability, and Schedules
- Dean-side Room CRUD
- Dean-side Subject CRUD (with teacher assignment from seeded accounts)
- Teacher-side availability input
- Teacher-side personal schedule view
- Generate Schedule action and schedule views for both roles
- Ant Design–based UI and layout

### Out of Scope

- Public sign-up / self-registration
- Admin role and in-app account creation
- Full-strength CSP/GA optimization (can start with a simpler valid-schedule algorithm, running either in a Convex action or an external Python service, and upgrade later)
- Manual drag-and-drop schedule editing
- Publishing, versioning, notifications, and analytics
- Teacher preferences (soft constraints) and change-request/conflict flagging

## Success Criteria

1. A seeded Dean and Teacher account can each log in via Clerk and land on the correct dashboard
2. A Dean can add, edit, and delete a Room in Convex, and changes persist and sync live
3. A Dean can add, edit, and delete a Subject, including selecting a teacher from seeded accounts
4. A logged-in Teacher can mark unavailable time slots and see those saved to their account in Convex
5. Clicking "Generate Schedule" produces a viewable timetable with no UI errors
6. A Teacher viewing their schedule sees only their own assigned classes, correctly filtered
